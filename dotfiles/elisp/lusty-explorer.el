;;; Commentary:
;;
;; To install, copy this file somewhere in your load-path and add this line to
;; your .emacs:
;;
;;    (require 'lusty-explorer)
;;
;; To launch the explorer, run or bind the following commands:
;;
;;    M-x lusty-file-explorer
;;    M-x lusty-buffer-explorer
;;
;;  And then use as you would `find-file' or `switch-to-buffer'.  (There are
;;  minor differences in entry selection, e.g. tab-completing when there is a
;;  only a single completion will select that completion.)  A split window
;;  shows the *Lusty-Completions* buffer, which updates dynamically as you
;;  type.
