! Some brief info for posterity.
!
! - xterm-related resources are defined in:
!
!     /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm
!
!   And also, when `*customization: -color` is set (always):
!
!     /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color
!
!   (And probably other places.)
!
! - To query the resources loaded for the XTerm class:
!     $ appres XTerm
!
! - You probably only want to have one of ~/.Xdefaults or ~/.Xresources. If
!   you`re using both, it should be based on a conscious, informed reason. If
!   you have only one (common case), it should probably be ~/.Xresources.
!
!   (There is also ~/.Xdefaults-<hostname> -- you probably don`t need it.)
!
! - Apostrophes/single-quotes are backticks in these comments because xrdb
!   interprets lone single-quote as an unclosed string and emits a warning.
!
! - "XTerm" resources apply to both xterm and uxterm (which is a simple wrapper
!   script on xterm). There`s also "UXTerm", which is specific to uxterm.
!
! - "XTerm" resources should apply also to rxvt and urxvt/rxvt-unicode, but in
!   my experience this doesn`t always work (or more likely, I misunderstand
!   what`s going on). So there is redundancy in this file.

!! TERM variable:
!
! Ensure programs/libraries (e.g. ncurses) use the terminfo entry that allows
! 256 colors. Shouldn`t be necessary these days, but doesn`t hurt.
! Note: there is also e.g. xterm-direct for true color. But my package
! manager`s version of xterm doesn`t support true color yet.
XTerm.termName: xterm-256color
UXTerm.termName: xterm-256color
URxvt.termName: rxvt-unicode-256color

!! xterm:
!
! Aside: Why the "*" instead of "."?  A lot of the interesting resources are
! XTerm.vt100.foo rather than XTerm.foo. But some are XTerm.foo.
!
! Force UTF-8 even if not launched as `uxterm`.
!XTerm*utf8: true
!*utf8Title: true
! Arbitrary, but well above the Ubuntu default of 1024.
XTerm*saveLines: 32768
! xterm`s scrollbar is obtrusive.
XTerm*scrollBar: false

!! urxvt:
!
! Aside: "Rxvt" resources apply also to urxvt/rxvt-unicode, but no one uses
! the original rxvt anymore.
URxvt.saveLines: 32768
URxvt.scrollstyle: plain
! Fade text by 15% when focus is lost.
URxvt.fading: 15
! Thin scrollbar. 5 seems to be the minimum.
URxvt.thickness: 5
! Don`t change font color for bold (rather, just use a bold font).
!URxvt.intensityStyles: false 

!! Colors:
!
! I think this is from the default palette of gnome-terminal (at least as it
! was at one time).
!
! Because of the other color specificiations present in /etc/X11/app-defaults
! we need to specify XTerm`s colors with some specificity to ensure they take
! precedence. E.g. on my system UXTerm-color shows "*VT100*color5: magenta3",
! and that will "win" against "*color5: #75507b" because the former is more
! specific in its wildcard usage.
